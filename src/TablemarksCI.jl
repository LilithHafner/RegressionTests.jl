"""
    differentiate(f, g)

Determine if `f()` and `g()` have different distributions.

Returns `false` if `f` and `g` have the same distribution and usually returns `true` if
they have different distributions.

Properties

- If `f` and `g` have the same distribution, the probability of a false positive is `1e-10`.
- If `f` and `g` have distributions that differ* by at least `.05`, then the probability of
    a false negative is `.05`.
- If `f` and `g` have the same distribution, `f` and `g` will each be called 53 times, on
    average
- `f` and `g` will each be called at most 300 times.

The difference between distributions is quantified as the integral from 0 to 1 of
`(cdf(g)(invcdf(f)(x)) - x)^2` where `cdf` and `invcdf` are higher order functions that
compute the cumulative distribution function and inverse cumulative distribution function,
respectively.

More generally, for any `k > .025`, `recall` loss is according to empirical estimation,
at most `max(1e-4, 20^(1-k/.025))`. So, for example, a regression with `k = .1`, will be
escape detection at most 1 out of 8000 times.
